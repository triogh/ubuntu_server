Introduction
+++

Configuration management systems are designed to make controlling large numbers of servers easy for administrators and operations teams. They allow you to control many different systems in an automated way from one central location.

While there are many popular configuration management systems available for Linux systems, such as Chef and Puppet, these are often more complex than many people want or need. Ansible is a great alternative to these options because it has a much smaller overhead to get started.

In this guide, we will discuss how to install Ansible on an Ubuntu 12.04 machine and go over some basics of how to use the software.


How Does Ansible Work?
+++

Ansible works by configuring client machines from an computer with Ansible components installed and configured.

It communicates over normal SSH channels in order to retrieve information from remote machines, issue commands, and copy files. Because of this, an Ansible system does not require any additional software to be installed on the client computers.

This is one way that Ansible simplifies the administration of servers. Any server that has an SSH port exposed can be brought under Ansible's configuration umbrella, regardless of what stage it is at in its life cycle.

Any computer that you can administer through SSH, you can also administer through Ansible.

Ansible takes on a modular approach, making it easy to extend to use the functionalities of the main system to deal with specific scenarios. Modules can be written in any language and communicate in standard JSON.

Configuration files are mainly written in the YAML data serialization format due to its expressive nature and its similarity to popular markup languages. Ansible can interact with clients through either command line tools or through its configuration scripts called Playbooks.


Install Ansible on an Ubuntu 12.04 VPS
+++

To begin exploring Ansible as a means of managing our various servers, we need to install the Ansible software on at least one machine. 

MY_NOTE:
Ansible is now available in the default Ubuntu repositories, so there is no need for additional third party repos.


        #
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install ansible


Set Up SSH Keys
+++

As we mentioned above, Ansible primarily communicates with client computers through SSH. While it certainly has the ability to handle password-based SSH authentication, SSH keys help keep things simple.

We can set up SSH keys in two different ways depending on whether you already have a key you want to use. We will assume that the servers you want to be administering will be DigitalOcean droplets.


Create a New SSH Key Pair
---

If you do not already have an SSH key pair that you would like to use for Ansible administration, we can create one now on your Ansible VPS.

We will create an SSH key pair on our Ansible droplet to authenticate with the hosts that it will administer.

As the user you will be controlling Ansible with, create an RSA key-pair by typing:

ssh-keygen
~~~

        #
        ssh-keygen


You will be asked to specify the file location of the created key pair, a passphrase, and the passphrase confirmation. Press ENTER through all of these to accept the default values.

Your new keys are available in your user's ~/.ssh directory. The public key (the one you can share) is called id_rsa.pub. The private key (the one that you keep secure) is called id_rsa.


You can add them to your DigitalOcean control panel to allow you to embed your SSH key into newly created droplets. This will allow your Ansible droplet to SSH into your new droplets immediately, without any other authentication.

To do this, click on the "SSH Keys" link on the left-hand navigation menu. In the new screen, click on the "Add SSH Key" button in the top-right corner:


Enter the name you want associated with this key into the top field. On your Ansible VPS instance, type this to get the contents of your public key:


        #
        cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDzmGgsqjSFuOBbjZB1sgquKpp3Ty+FgqoLrzjKbbk9VGOH6kM37aAhyxxmTQfe69lhYi/WCai+mrXOyY9IiQbUfZ4jsfPE9DS3zHhmnGiBWA7pedCTJ/Nhf06dmhAJIbExW3uDghbPbzbSA5Ihn1x0F5FXtSMDoFtyjcwUwJxc2z/kk9TKcFSl8qqf4IYBYE7c+EKaYRBjjDP4AQmiwjTPuipsmub7C0OGF0dTMatIa0lok6rwy91nmhCQV6polG0+Fsk4YrY8Yh5xz6wE0lOvc8BwP9nL0zsnw6Ey0MHV9BbMqtyD6x/fCurpIkMHJK4nv79rToSWA0AwoP/bJXh7 demo@ansible0


The string that is given back to you is what you need to paste in the second field in the DigitalOcean control panel:


Click "Create SSH Key" to add your key to the control panel. Now, whenever you create a new droplet, you will be able to embed your public SSH key into the new server, allowing you to communicate with your Ansible instance. You just need to select the key in the "Add optional SSH Keys" section of the droplet creation process:


Transfer an Existing SSH Key Pair to Ansible
---

If you already have a SSH key pair that you are using to authenticate with your droplets, you can transfer the credentials to your new Ansible droplet instead of creating a new pair. This has the advantage of making it automatically work with any servers you have already configured to use the key.

On the computer where you have configured SSH key authentication for your droplets, get the public key by typing:


        #
        cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDzmGgsqjSFuOBbjZB1sgquKpp3Ty+FgqoLrzjKbbk9VGOH6kM37aAhyxxmTQfe69lhYi/WCai+mrXOyY9IiQbUfZ4jsfPE9DS3zHhmnGiBWA7pedCTJ/Nhf06dmhAJIbExW3uDghbPbzbSA5Ihn1x0F5FXtSMDoFtyjcwUwJxc2z/kk9TKcFSl8qqf4IYBYE7c+EKaYRBjjDP4AQmiwjTPuipsmub7C0OGF0dTMatIa0lok6rwy91nmhCQV6polG0+Fsk4YrY8Yh5xz6wE0lOvc8BwP9nL0zsnw6Ey0MHV9BbMqtyD6x/fCurpIkMHJK4nv79rToSWA0AwoP/bJXh7 demo@ansible0


On your Ansible server, you need to create a hidden directory to store your keys. Call it .ssh so that the SSH program knows where to find it:


        #
        mkdir ~/.ssh


We should lock access to this directory down so that only you can enter or write to it:


        #
        chmod 700 ~/.ssh


Now, move into the directory and open a file called id_rsa.pub in your text editor:


        #
        cd ~/.ssh
        nano id_rsa.pub


Paste the output of your public key from your home computer into this file:


        #
        ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDzmGgsqjSFuOBbjZB1sgquKpp3Ty+FgqoLrzjKbbk9VGOH6kM37aAhyxxmTQfe69lhYi/WCai+mrXOyY9IiQbUfZ4jsfPE9DS3zHhmnGiBWA7pedCTJ/Nhf06dmhAJIbExW3uDghbPbzbSA5Ihn1x0F5FXtSMDoFtyjcwUwJxc2z/kk9TKcFSl8qqf4IYBYE7c+EKaYRBjjDP4AQmiwjTPuipsmub7C0OGF0dTMatIa0lok6rwy91nmhCQV6polG0+Fsk4YrY8Yh5xz6wE0lOvc8BwP9nL0zsnw6Ey0MHV9BbMqtyD6x/fCurpIkMHJK4nv79rToSWA0AwoP/bJXh7 demo@ansible0



Save and close the file. We will make sure that this file has the correct permissions by typing:


        #
        chmod 644 id_rsa.pub


Now, back on your local computer that is configured for SSH key access, type:


        #
        cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        MIIEpgIBAAKCAQEA85hoLKo0hbjgW42QdbIKriqad08vhYKqC684ym25PVRjh+pD
        N+2gIcl8Zk0H3uvZYWIv1gmsfpq1zsmPSIkG1H2eI7HzxPQ0qMx4ZpxogVgO6XnQ

        qVJgG+TS9BRC+IowuzMVV5mzrfJjkrb+GG+xWSXrTLZMbeeTf+D0SfVo
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----


The output will be quite long.

Back on your Ansible droplet, we need to create a new file in the ~/.ssh directory:


        #
        nano id_rsa


Inside, paste the results of the previous command on your local computer:


        #
        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        MIIEpgIBAAKCAQEA85hoLKo0hbjgW42QdbIKriqad08vhYKqC684ym25PVRjh+pD

        qVJgG+TS9BRC+IowuzMVV5mzrfJjkrb+GG+xWSXrTLZMbeeTf+D0SfVo
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----


Make sure that you include the first and last marker lines. They are required in order for the key file to be valid. Save and close the file.

We need to change the permissions to keep this file secure:


        #
        chmod 600 id_rsa


At this point, Ansible will be able to use these SSH keys to communicate with any servers that have the key embedded.


MY_NOTE:
When testing with a Vagrant box, I just copied the ssh public key from the host machine to the ".ssh/authorized_keys" file in the Vagrant box, and restarted the ssh daemon. Then I can connect with the command below.


        #
        $ ssh vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p2222


Configuring Ansible Hosts
+++

Ansible keeps track of all of the servers that it knows about through a "hosts" file. We need to set up this file first before we can begin to communicate with our other computers.

Open the file with root privileges like this:


        #
        sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts


You will see a file that has a lot of example configurations, none of which will actually work for us since these hosts are made up. So to start, let's comment out all of the lines in this file by adding a "#" before each line.

We will keep these examples in the file to help us with configuration if we want to implement more complex scenarios in the future.

Once all of the lines are commented out, we can begin adding our actual hosts.

The hosts file is fairly flexible and can be configured in a few different ways. The syntax we are going to use though looks something like this:


        #
        [group_name]
        alias ansible_ssh_host=server_ip_address


The group_name is an organizational tag that lets you refer to any servers listed under it with one word. The alias is just a name to refer to that server.

So in our scenario, we are imagining that we have three servers we are going to control with Ansible. These servers are accessible from the Ansible droplet by typing:


        #
        ssh root@server_ip_address


You should not be prompted for a password if you have set this up correctly. We will assume that our droplets' IP addresses are 192.0.2.1, 192.0.2.2, and 192.0.2.3. We will set this up so that we can refer to these individually as host1, host2, and host3, or as a group as droplets.

This is the block that we should add to our hosts file to accomplish this:


        #
        [droplets]
        host1 ansible_ssh_host=192.0.2.1
        host2 ansible_ssh_host=192.0.2.2
        host3 ansible_ssh_host=192.0.2.3



MY_NOTE:
This is what I did on my test host machine, so that I could reach the Vagrant box I created previously, and where I copied the public ssh key, into the authorized_keys file on the Vagrant box.


        #
        [test_group]
        test_machine ansible_host=127.0.0.1 ansible_port=2222 ansible_user=vagrant


Relevant Ansible docs for the inventory file.
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html


        #
        $ ansible all -m ping
        test_machine | SUCCESS => {
            "changed": false, 
            "ping": "pong"
        }



Hosts can be in multiple groups and groups can configure parameters for all of their members. Let's try this out now.

With our current settings, if we tried to connect to any of these hosts with Ansible, the command would fail (assuming you are not operating as the root user). This is because your SSH key is embedded for the root user on the remote systems and Ansible will by default try to connect as your current user. A connection attempt will get this error:


        #
        host1 | FAILED => SSH encountered an unknown error during the connection. We recommend you re-run the command using -vvvv, which will enable SSH debugging output to help diagnose the issue


In my Ansible computer, I'm using a user called demo. Ansible will try to connect to each host with ssh demo@server. This will not work if the demo user is not on the remote system.

We can create a file that tells all of the servers in the "droplets" group to connect using the root user.

To do this, we will create a directory in the Ansible configuration structure called group_vars. Within this folder, we can create YAML-formatted files for each group we want to configure:

/etc/ansible/group_vars
---

/etc/ansible/group_vars/droplet
---

        #
        sudo mkdir /etc/ansible/group_vars
        sudo nano /etc/ansible/group_vars/droplets

We can put our configuration in here. YAML files start with "---", so make sure you don't forget that part.


ansible_ssh_user: root
---

        #
		#
        ---
        ansible_ssh_user: root



Save and close this file when you are finished.

If you want to specify configuration details for every server, regardless of group association, you can put those details in a file at: 


/etc/ansible/group_vars/all
---

        #
        /etc/ansible/group_vars/all 


Individual hosts can be configured by creating files under a directory at 

/etc/ansible/host_vars
---

        #
        /etc/ansible/host_vars


Using Simple Ansible Commands
+++

Now that we have our hosts set up and enough configuration details to allow us to successfully connect to our hosts, we can try out our very first command.

Ping all of the servers you configured by typing:


$ ansible -m ping all
---


        #
		host1 | success >> {
			"changed": false,
			"ping": "pong"
		}

		host3 | success >> {
			"changed": false,
			"ping": "pong"
		}

		host2 | success >> {
			"changed": false,
			"ping": "pong"
		}


This is a basic test to make sure that Ansible has a connection to all of its hosts.

The "all" means all hosts. We could just as easily specify a group:

$ ansible -m ping droplets
---


We could also specify an individual host:

$ ansible -m ping host1
---


We can specify multiple hosts by separating them with colons:

$ ansible -m ping host1:host2
---


The -m ping portion of the command is an instruction to Ansible to use the "ping" module. These are basically commands that you can run on your remote hosts. The ping module operates in many ways like the normal ping utility in Linux, but instead it checks for Ansible connectivity.

The ping module doesn't really take any arguments, but we can try another command to see how that works. We pass arguments into a script by typing -a.

The "shell" module lets us send a terminal command to the remote host and retrieve the results. For instance, to find out the memory usage on our host1 machine, we could use:


$ ansible -m shell -a 'free -m' host1
---


		#
		host1 | success | rc=0 >>
					 total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
		Mem:          3954        227       3726          0         14         93
		-/+ buffers/cache:        119       3834
		Swap:            0          0          0



Conclusion

By now, you should have your Ansible server configured to communicate with the servers that you would like to control. We have verified that Ansible can communicate with each host and we have used the ansible command to execute simple tasks remotely.

Although this is useful, we have not covered the most powerful feature of Ansible in this article: Playbooks. We have set up a great foundation for working with our servers through Ansible, but the heavy lifting will be done in a future article, when we cover how to use Playbooks to automate configuration of your remote computers.

In the section "Using Simple Ansible Commands," you say, "We can specify multiple hosts by separating them with colons." More precisely you can do the union, intersection, or difference of the machines or groups listed. The Ansible documents on this are a bit weak, http://docs.ansible.com/intro_patterns.html but I learned it from http://zaiste.net/2014/05/ansible_101/ . Look at the middle of the page for the section named Usage. "Groups can be combined A:B designates the union of groups A and B A:&B designates the intersection of groups A and B A:!B designates the difference, all from A without those in B"

Good introductory tutorial! I think it would be interesting to point that connecting and running the tasks as root might not be the best practice on a daily basis, as all commands will be executed as root.

Introduction
+++

Ansible is an easy configuration management system that can be used to automate and organize your system configuration tasks for a large network of computers. While some other configuration management systems require many different packages to be installed on the server and client systems, with Ansible, you only need to install a server component and have SSH access to the client machines.


In a previous guide, we discussed how to install the Ansible software and learn basic commands. In this guide, we will discuss Ansible playbooks, which are Ansible's way of creating automated scripts to configure client computers.

We will assume that you have a configured Ansible server and a few clients, just as we left off in the last tutorial. In our guide, the server is a Ubuntu 12.04 machine, and the clients that we are going to be configuring are also Ubuntu 12.04 machines, for ease of explanation.



What are Ansible Playbooks?
+++

Ansible playbooks are a way to send commands to remote computers in a scripted way. Instead of using Ansible commands individually to remotely configure computers from the command line, you can configure entire complex environments by passing a script to one or more systems.

Ansible playbooks are written in the YAML data serialization format. If you don't know what a data serialization format is, think of it as a way to translate a programmatic data structure (lists, arrays, dictionaries, etc) into a format that can be easily stored to disk. The file can then be used to recreate the structure at a later point. JSON is another popular data serialization format, but YAML is much easier to read.


Each playbook contains one or more plays, which map hosts to a certain function. Ansible does this through something called tasks, which are basically module calls.


Exploring a Basic Playbook
+++

Let's look at a basic playbook:



		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: droplets
		  tasks:
			- name: Installs nginx web server
			  apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true
			  notify:
				- start nginx

		  handlers:
			- name: start nginx
			  service: name=nginx state=started


Let's break this down in sections so we can understand how these files are built and what each piece means.

The file starts with:


		#
		#
		---


This is a requirement for YAML to interpret the file as a proper document. YAML allows multiple "documents" to exist in one file, each separated by ---, but Ansible only wants one per file, so this should only be present at the top of the file.

YAML is very sensitive to white-space, and uses that to group different pieces of information together. You should use only spaces and not tabs and you must use consistent spacing for your file to be read correctly. Items at the same level of indentation are considered sibling elements.


Items that begin with a - are considered list items. Items that have the format of key: value operate as hashes or dictionaries. That's pretty much all there is to basic YAML.


YAML documents basically define a hierarchical tree structure with the containing elements further to the left.

On the second line, we have this:


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: droplets


This is a list item in YAML as we learned above, but since it is at the left-most level, it is also an Ansible "play". Plays are basically groups of tasks that are performed on a certain set of hosts to allow them to fulfill the function you want to assign to them. Each play must specify a host or group of hosts, as we do here.

Next, we have a set of tasks:


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: droplets
		  tasks:
			- name: Installs nginx web server
			  apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true
			  notify:
				- start nginx



At the top level, we have "tasks:" at the same level as "hosts:". This contains a list (because it starts with a "-") which contains key-value pairs.

The first one, "name", is more of a description than a name. You can call this whatever you would like.

The next key is "apt". This is a reference to an Ansible module, just like when we use the ansible command and type something like:

$ ansible -m apt -a 'whatever' all
---


This module allows us to specify a package and the state that it should be in, which is "installed" in our case. The update-cache=true part tells our remote machine to update its package cache (apt-get update) prior to installing the software.

The "notify" item contains a list with one item, which is called "start nginx". This is not an internal Ansible command, it is a reference to a handler, which can perform certain functions when it is called from within a task. We will define the "start nginx" handler below.


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: droplets
		  tasks:
			- name: Installs nginx web server
			  apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true
			  notify:
				- start nginx

		  handlers:
			- name: start nginx
			  service: name=nginx state=started


The "handlers" section exists at the same level as the "hosts" and "tasks". Handlers are just like tasks, but they only run when they have been told by a task that changes have occurred on the client system.


For instance, we have a handler here that starts the Nginx service after the package is installed. The handler is not called unless the "Installs nginx web server" task results in changes to the system, meaning that the package had to be installed and wasn't already there.

We can save this playbook into a file called something like "nginx.yml".

Just for some context, if you were to write this same file in JSON, it might look something like this:


		#
		#
		[
			{
				"hosts": "droplets",
				"tasks": [
					{
						"name": "Installs nginx web server",
						"apt": "pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true",
						"notify": [
							"start nginx"
						]
					}
				],
				"handlers": [
					{
						"name": "start nginx",
						"service": "name=nginx state=started"
					}
				]
			}
		]



As you can see, YAML is much more compact and most people would say more readable.


MY_NOTE:
Two perl scripts, first just a proof of concept.
Second works on the example playbook given above, and translates it to JSON, but it had problems with tabs, and so i had to remove tabs, and use spaces instead as indentation in YAML.



First script.

		#
		$ cat yaml2json.pl
		#!/usr/bin/env perl
		# Name:
		# Version:

		use strict;
		use warnings;

		use YAML;
		use JSON;

		# Load a YAML hash containing a scalar ref as a value.
		my ($hashref) = Load(<<'END_YAML');
		---
		bar: ref
		foo: 1
		END_YAML

		use Data::Dump;
		dd $hashref;

		my $json_text = encode_json($hashref);


Output:

		#
		$ perl yaml2json.pl
		{ bar => "ref", foo => 1 }


Second script.


		#
		$ cat yaml2json_2.pl
		#!/usr/bin/env perl
		# Name:
		# Version:

		use strict;
		use warnings;

		use YAML;
		use JSON;

		my $slurped;

		{
		local $/ = undef;
		$slurped = <DATA>;
		}

		# Load a YAML hash containing a scalar ref as a value.
		my ($hashref) = Load($slurped);

		use Data::Dump;
		dd $hashref;

		my $json_text = encode_json($hashref);
		__DATA__
		---
		- hosts: droplets
		  tasks:
			- name: Installs nginx web server
			  apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true
			  notify:
				- start nginx

		  handlers:
			- name: start nginx
			  service: name=nginx state=started




Output:

		
		#
		$ perl yaml2json_2.pl
		[
		  {
			handlers => [
						  { name => "start nginx", service => "name=nginx state=started" },
						],
			hosts    => "droplets",
			tasks    => [
						  {
							apt => "pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true",
							name => "Installs nginx web server",
							notify => ["start nginx"],
						  },
						],
		  },
		]

Running an Ansible Playbook
+++

Once you have a playbook built, you can call it easily using this format:

$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml
---

For instance, if we wanted to install and start up Nginx on all of our droplets, we could issue this command:

$ ansible-playbook nginx.yml
---

Since the playbook itself specifies the hosts that it should run against (namely, the "droplets" group we created in the last tutorial), we do not have to specify a host to run against.

However, if we would like to filter the host list to only apply to one of those hosts, we can add a flag to specify a subset of the hosts in the file:


$ ansible-playbook -l host_subset playbook.yml
---

$ ansible-playbook -l host3 nginx.yml
---


Adding Features to the Playbook
+++

Right now our playbook looks like this:


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: droplets
		  tasks:
			- name: Installs nginx web server
			  apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true
			  notify:
				- start nginx

		  handlers:
			- name: start nginx
			  service: name=nginx state=started


It is simple and it works, but all it is doing is installing a piece of software and starting it. That's not very beneficial by itself.

We can start to expand the functionality by adding tasks to our playbook.


Add a Default Index File
+++


We can tell it to transfer a file from our Ansible server onto the host by adding some lines like this:

		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: droplets
		  tasks:
			- name: Installs nginx web server
			  apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true
			  notify:
				- start nginx

			- name: Upload default index.html for host
			  copy: src=static_files/index.html dest=/usr/share/nginx/www/ mode=0644

		  handlers:
			- name: start nginx
			  service: name=nginx state=started


We can then make a directory called static_files in our current directory and place an index.html file inside.


		#
		mkdir static_files
		nano static_files/index.html


Inside of this file, let's just create a basic html structure:


		#
		<html>
		  <head>
			<title>This is a sample page</title>
		  </head>
		  <body>
			<h1>Here is a heading!</h1>
			<p>Here is a regular paragraph.  Wow!</p>
		  </body>
		</html>



Save and close the file.

Now, when we re-run the playbook, Ansible will check each task. It will see that Nginx is already installed on the host, so it will leave it be. It will see the new task section and replace the default index.html file with the one from our server.


Registering Results
+++

When you are installing and configuring services manually, it is almost always necessary to know whether your actions were successful or not. We can cook this functionality into our playbooks by using "register".

For each task, we can optionally register its result (failure or success) in a variable that we can check later on.

When using this functionality, we also have to tell Ansible to ignore errors for that task, since normally it aborts the playbook execution for that host if any trouble happens.

So, if we want to check whether a task has failed or not to decide on subsequent steps, we can use the register functionality.


For instance, we could tell our playbook to upload an index.php file if it exists. If that task fails, we could instead try to upload an index.html file. We will check for the failure condition in the other task because we only want to upload the HTML file if the PHP file fails:


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: droplets
		  tasks:
			- name: Installs nginx web server
			  apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true
			  notify:
				- start nginx

			- name: Upload default index.php for host
			  copy: src=static_files/index.php dest=/usr/share/nginx/www/ mode=0644
			  register: php
			  ignore_errors: True

			- name: Remove index.html for host
			  command: rm /usr/share/nginx/www/index.html
			  when: php|success

			- name: Upload default index.html for host
			  copy: src=static_files/index.html dest=/usr/share/nginx/www/ mode=0644
			  when: php|failed

		  handlers:
			- name: start nginx
			  service: name=nginx state=started


Note: We have not configured our host to handle PHP files at this time, so even if you did upload a PHP file, it would not be processed correctly.

This new version tries to upload a PHP index file to the host. It registers the success of the operation into a variable called "php".

If this operation was successful, the task to remove the index.html file is run next.

If the operation failed, the index.html file is uploaded instead.


Conclusion

Now, you should have a good handle on how to automate complex tasks using Ansible. This is a basic example of how you can begin to build your configuration library.

Combining host and group definitions as we learned about in the first tutorial, and using available variables to fill in information, we can begin to put together complex computer systems that interact with each other. In a future article, we will discuss how to implement variables into our playbooks and create roles to help manage complex tasks.

According to the ansible docs(http://docs.ansible.com/apt_module.html) the command equivalent to apt-get update is actually update_cache=yes rather than update_cache=true Otherwise, I like the tutorial.

Introduction
+++

Ansible is an easy to use configuration management system that can assist you in configuring large numbers of servers from a single machine. You can automate complex tasks and easily add machines to your infrastructure without too much trouble.

In previous articles, we discussed how to install and configure Ansible and how to create playbooks to automate system configuration. In this guide, we will discuss how to use Ansible roles to allow you to break up configuration into more modular steps.


We will assume that you have Ansible installed on one Ubuntu 12.04 VPS as we demonstrated in the previous guides. You will also need one or more other computers configured as hosts within the Ansible configuration.


What is an Ansible Role?
+++


You've been exposed to how Ansible can interact with configured clients from the command line with the ansible command, and how you can automate configuration with playbooks run through the ansible-playbook command. Where do roles fit into this scheme?

Simply put, roles are a further level of abstraction that can be useful for organizing playbooks. As you add more and more functionality and flexibility to your playbooks, they can become unwieldy and difficult to maintain as a single file. Roles allow you to create very minimal playbooks that then look to a directory structure to determine the actual configuration steps they need to perform.

Organizing things into roles also allows you to reuse common configuration steps between different types of servers. This is already possible by "including" other files within a playbook, but with roles, these types of links between files are automatic based on a specific directory hierarchy.

In general, the idea behind roles is to allow you to define what a server is supposed to do, instead of having to specify the exact steps needed to get a server to act a certain way.


Creating Role Framework
+++

In order for Ansible to correctly handle roles, we need to build a directory structure that it can find and understand. We can do this by creating a "roles" directory in our working directory for Ansible.

We're assuming here that you've been using your user's home directory as the Ansible working directory. You should change to whatever actual directory you are keeping your Ansible configuration in.

We are going to create a directory called "roles" where Ansible will look for our roles.

mkdir roles
---

        #
        cd ~
        mkdir roles
        cd roles


Within this directory, we will define our roles. We will basically create a directory for each role that we will create. Since we are going to replicate our Nginx playbook, let's create an Nginx role:

mkdir nginx
---

		#
		mkdir nginx
		cd nginx


Within this directory, we create another set of directories that will help us separate the different sections of a normal playbook. Create these directories now:


mkdir defaults files handlers meta templates tasks vars
---

		#
		mkdir defaults files handlers meta templates tasks vars 


These are the directories that will contain all of the code to implement our configuration. You may not use all of the directories, so in real practice, you may not need to create all of these directories.


This is what they are all for:


    - files: This directory contains regular files that need to be transferred to the hosts you are configuring for this role. This may also include script files to run.
    - handlers: All handlers that were in your playbook previously can now be added into this directory.
    - meta: This directory can contain files that establish role dependencies. You can list roles that must be applied before the current role can work correctly.
    - templates: You can place all files that use variables to substitute information during creation in this directory.
    - tasks: This directory contains all of the tasks that would normally be in a playbook. These can reference files and templates contained in their respective directories without using a path.
    - vars: Variables for the roles can be specified in this directory and used in your configuration files.

Within all of the directories but the "files" and "templates", if a file called main.yml exists, its contents will be automatically added to the playbook that calls the role.


Abstracting a Playbook to a Role
+++

For many playbooks, it would make more sense to implement the functionality as a role. We can turn our Nginx playbook from the last article into a role to organize things better.

We should already have the roles/nginx/{subdirectories} structure set up from the last section. Now, we need to create some main.yml files in our structure.


Creating the Tasks main.yml File
+++

We'll start with the tasks subdirectory. Move to that directory now:


		#
		cd ~/roles/nginx/tasks


Now, we need to copy the nginx.yml file into this directory:


		#
		cp ~/nginx.yml main.yml


Now, we need to edit the main file and remove everything that is not a tasks:


		#
		nano main.yml


The file should look like this when you begin:



		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: droplets
		  tasks:
			- name: Installs nginx web server
			  apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true
			  notify:
				- start nginx

			- name: Upload default index.php for host
			  copy: src=static_files/index.php dest=/usr/share/nginx/www/ mode=0644
			  register: php
			  ignore_errors: True

			- name: Remove index.html for host
			  command: rm /usr/share/nginx/www/index.html
			  when: php|success

			- name: Upload default index.html for host
			  copy: src=static_files/index.html dest=/usr/share/nginx/www/ mode=0644
			  when: php|failed

		  handlers:
			- name: start nginx
			  service: name=nginx state=started


We only want to keep the lines that are red. 


		#
		- name: Installs nginx web server
		  apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true
		  notify:
			- start nginx

		- name: Upload default index.php for host
		  copy: src=static_files/index.php dest=/usr/share/nginx/www/ mode=0644
		  register: php
		  ignore_errors: True

		- name: Remove index.html for host
		  command: rm /usr/share/nginx/www/index.html
		  when: php|success

		- name: Upload default index.html for host
		  copy: src=static_files/index.html dest=/usr/share/nginx/www/ mode=0644
		  when: php|failed




Furthermore, we can remove the extraneous spaces to the left of our tasks. After our changes, our new tasks/main.yml file will look like this:


		#
		#
		---
		- name: Installs nginx web server
		  apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true
		  notify:
			- start nginx

		- name: Upload default index.php for host
		  copy: src=static_files/index.php dest=/usr/share/nginx/www/ mode=0644
		  register: php
		  ignore_errors: True

		- name: Remove index.html for host
		  command: rm /usr/share/nginx/www/index.html
		  when: php|success

		- name: Upload default index.html for host
		  copy: src=static_files/index.html dest=/usr/share/nginx/www/ mode=0644
		  when: php|failed



As you can see, this is a lot easier to read in terms of just recognizing the steps that are to be performed.

One additional change that we should make is how we references external files in our configuration. Our src lines reference a "static_files" directory. This is unnecessary if we place all of our static files in the "files" subdirectory. Ansible will find them automatically.

When we change those lines, our finished tasks/main.yml file looks like this:


		#
		#
		---
		- name: Installs nginx web server
		  apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true
		  notify:
			- start nginx

		- name: Upload default index.php for host
		  copy: src=index.php dest=/usr/share/nginx/www/ mode=0644
		  register: php
		  ignore_errors: True

		- name: Remove index.html for host
		  command: rm /usr/share/nginx/www/index.html
		  when: php|success

		- name: Upload default index.html for host
		  copy: src=index.html dest=/usr/share/nginx/www/ mode=0644
		  when: php|failed


Save and close the file when you are finished.


Creating the Handlers main.yml File
+++

Now that we have the bulk of the playbook in the tasks/main.yml file, we need to move the handlers section into a file located at handlers/main.yml.

Copy the nginx.yml file again, this time into the handlers directory:


		#
		cd ~/roles/nginx/handlers
		cp ~/nginx.yml main.yml


Again, open the file in your text editor:


		#
		nano main.yml


The parts that we need to keep are in red again:


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: droplets
		  tasks:
			- name: Installs nginx web server
			  apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true
			  notify:
				- start nginx

			- name: Upload default index.php for host
			  copy: src=static_files/index.php dest=/usr/share/nginx/www/ mode=0644
			  register: php
			  ignore_errors: True

			- name: Remove index.html for host
			  command: rm /usr/share/nginx/www/index.html
			  when: php|success

			- name: Upload default index.html for host
			  copy: src=static_files/index.html dest=/usr/share/nginx/www/ mode=0644
			  when: php|failed

		  handlers:
			- name: start nginx
			  service: name=nginx state=started



Remove the whitespace from before the handlers also. In the end, the file should look like this:


		#
		#
		---
		- name: start nginx
		  service: name=nginx state=started


Save and close the file when you are finished.


Finishing Up
+++

Since our original playbook was very simple, we're almost done.

First, we need to move the index.html page (and the index.php page if you created one) out of the ~/static_files directory and put them into the ~/roles/nginx/files directory:


		#
		cp ~/static_files/* ~/roles/nginx/files


If our role depended on another role, we could add a file in the meta directory called main.yml. This file might specify that this role depends on a role called "apt".

If our role depended on a role called "apt", the file at ~/roles/nginx/meta/main.yml might look like this:


		#
		#
		---
		dependencies:
		  - { role: apt }


This would take the "apt" role and place the information from that role before our Nginx information so that our role has its proper dependencies prior to starting.

We said earlier that there is a "vars" directory that can be used to set variables for our role. While it is possible to configure default parameters for a role through a vars/main.yml file, this is usually not recommended, because it makes the details of your configuration reside within the roles hierarchy.


Usually, you want to specify your details outside of the role so that you can easily share the role structure without worrying about leaking information. Also, variables declared within a role are easily overridden by variables in other locations, so they are not very strong to begin with.

By now, you may be wondering why we have to organize our information into directories, when most of our directories only contain a single main.yml file. Why aren't we creating tasks.yml files instead of tasks/main.yml?

The answer is that we are only using the minimum amount of files. The main.yml files are the ones picked up automatically by Ansible, but we can include additional files easily by using the include functionality.

If we had an additional task file used to configure SSL for some of our hosts located at tasks/ssl.yml, we could call it like this:


		#
		#
		. . .
		tasks:
		  - include: roles/nginx/tasks/ssl.yml


Create a Skeleton Playbook
+++

Now that we have configured our role structure, we can call all of the functionality with a very simple playbook.

This allows us to use playbooks to declare what a server is supposed to do, not what steps must happen to make it behave how we want it to.

Outside of the entire role structure, in our working directory (our home directory in this example), we can create a playbook file.


		#
		cd ~
		nano play.yml


Inside of this file, we need very little information. First, we have not defined any hosts, so that goes here. Next, we just declare the role we are using:


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: droplets
		  roles:
			- role: nginx


Save and close the file. This is our entire playbook. As you can see, it cleans everything up and allows us to concentrate on core functionality. If we had multiple roles configured, we could simply list what different things we want our server to do.

For instance, if we had roles to set up a WordPress server, we might have a playbook that looks like this:


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: wordpress_hosts
		  roles:
			- nginx
			- php
			- mysql
			- wordpress


As you can see, this allows us to be very succinct about what we want from a server. Since in the end, we use a playbook to call a role, the command syntax is exactly the same:


$ ansible-playbook play.yml
---


Conclusion

Ansible roles are an optional feature to take advantage of, but if you plan on using Ansible extensively, it is highly recommended that you explore this functionality. Not only will it keep your host-level configuration clean and readable, it will also allow you to easily reuse code and implement your changes in a modular fashion.

Great article, but you are missing "defaults" directory in which you can add default values for variables which basically get overridden by everything else.

Introduction
+++

Ansible is a configuration management tool that system administrators use to automate infrastructure management activities.

Ansible uses only SSH to run commands remotely, and thus does not need an agent on the remote server. This makes Ansible preferable over other popular tools like Puppet or Chef when you don't want to install agents on the managed servers.

Moreover, it is much easier to get started with Ansible because it uses YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) which is simpler than the more powerful programming languages that other tools use.

Drupal is a popular CMS whose installation is time-consuming, but easy to automate. In this tutorial, we are going to create an Ansible Playbook that automates the installation and configuration of Drupal and all its dependencies on systems that run Ubuntu 14.04. 


Prerequisites
+++

You will need the following:

    - Ubuntu 14.04 server (which is accessible over SSH); this server will run Ansible and a local copy of Drupal
    - Optional: Additional Ubuntu 14.04 servers where you want to install Drupal
    - A sudo user on each server; you should use the same username and same password for each server where you want to install Drupal
    - A basic understanding of how a Drupal installation works. You can refer to How To Install Drupal on an Ubuntu 14.04 Server with Apache, although you do not need to pre-install Drupal



Step 1  Install Ansible
+++

Update the package lists.
Install Ansible.


		#
		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install ansible


Step 2  Create a Directory for the Playbook
+++

Ansible's instruction sets are called playbooks. It's a good idea to store all your playbooks in a single directory. Create a directory named MyPlaybooks.


		#
		mkdir ~/MyPlaybooks


Let us name our playbook drupal_setup. Create a new directory named drupal_setup.


		#
		mkdir ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup


Step 3  Create a hosts File
+++

Each playbook usually has a hosts file that contains names of the servers that it should use.

In this tutorial, we are going to install Drupal on localhost and one other server, drupal_server. You are free to add more servers to this file. Remember, every server you add should be accessible over SSH.

Use nano to create and edit a file named hosts.


		#
		nano ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/hosts

Let it have the following contents:


		#
		[drupal_hosts]
		localhost
		drupal_server_ip

MY_NOTE:
I created the "hosts" file with the following content.


		#
		[drupal_hosts]
		test_machine ansible_host=127.0.0.1 ansible_port=2222 ansible_user=vagrant

You should replace drupalserverip with your second server's IP address. You can list as many IP addresses here as you want; you can use this playbook to install Drupal on any number of Ubuntu 14.04 servers.


    Note: The hosts file is the file you should update if you want to reuse this playbook in the future to configure more Drupal servers. Note that you should remove the already-configured servers from the list, and add your new server IPs, before you re-run the playbook.

Save and close the file.


Step 4  Create a Role to apt-get update
+++

Create a new directory to store all the roles of the Playbook.


		#
		mkdir ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/roles


We need to apt-get update the servers before doing anything else, so create a directory for the role update.


		#
		mkdir ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/roles/update


Each role has one or more tasks. Create a directory named tasks to hold all tasks associated with this role.


		#
		mkdir ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/roles/update/tasks


Use nano to create and edit a new task file named main.yml. This is the file that tells Ansible what to do when it executes this role.


		#
		nano ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/roles/update/tasks/main.yml


In this file, use Ansible's apt module to update the system:


		#
		#
		---
		- name: apt-get update the server
		  apt: update_cache=yes


Make sure your file doesn't have any extra whitespace; Ansible is picky about this. Save and close the file.


Step 5 — Create a Role to Set Up PHP
+++

Create a directory for the role php.


		#
		mkdir ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/roles/php

Create the tasks directory for this role:


		#
		mkdir ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/roles/php/tasks


Drupal needs a web server which is configured to use PHP. In this tutorial, we use Apache. When we install PHP, Apache is installed automatically, so we don't need any extra commands for it.

Use nano to create and edit the main.yml for the php role.


		#
		nano ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/roles/php/tasks/main.yml


Use Ansible's apt module to install PHP5 (and the packages it depends on), and the PHP5 GD library. Add the following to the file:


		#
		#
		---
		- name: Install PHP and associated packages
		  apt: name=php5 state=latest

		- name: Install PHP GD library
		  apt: name=php5-gd state=latest
		  notify:
			- Restart Apache


Apache has to be restarted after the PHP GD library is installed. Therefore, this role also needs a handler.

All handlers of a role are stored in a separate directory. Create a directory named handlers for the current role.


		#
		mkdir ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/roles/php/handlers


Use nano to create and edit the main.yml file.


		#
		nano ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/roles/php/handlers/main.yml

Add the following code to it:


		#
		#
		---
		- name: Restart Apache
		  service: name=apache2 state=restarted

You're done with the PHP and Apache setup.



Step 6  Create a Role to Set Up MySQL
+++

Drupal needs a database to store settings and content. In this tutorial, we use MySQL.

Create directories for this role and its tasks.


		#
		mkdir -p ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/roles/mysql/tasks


The first task of this role installs MySQL and its dependencies. Use nano to create and edit a file named setup.yml.


		#
		nano ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/roles/mysql/tasks/setup.yml


In this file, we will tell Ansible to use the apt module again to install:


    - mysql-server
    - libapache2-mod-auth-mysql
    - php5-mysql


So, add the following to the file:


		#
		#
		---
		- name: Install MySQL server
		  apt: name=mysql-server state=latest

		- name: Install Apache module for MySQL authentication
		  apt: name=libapache2-mod-auth-mysql state=latest

		- name: Install MySQL module for PHP
		  apt: name=php5-mysql state=latest


Our role has one more tasks file. As Drupal needs its own MySQL database and database user, we will create a separate tasks file to create them. Use nano to create and edit a file named create_db.yml.


		#
		nano ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/roles/mysql/tasks/create_db.yml


Ansible has modules that let you manage MySQL. In this task, we will use the following modules:


    - mysql_db - To create a new database for Drupal.
    - mysql_user To create a new user and allow it to access the database.


Before we use mysql_db or mysql_user we should make sure that the Python MySQLdb package is installed on the remote host. Use the apt module to install it.

Add the following contents to the file:


		#
		#
		---
		- name: Install Python MySQLdb
		  apt: name=python-mysqldb state=latest

		- name: Create the Drupal database
		  mysql_db: db={{ db_name }} state=present

		- name: Create the Drupal user
		  mysql_user: >
			name={{ db_user }}
			password={{ db_password }}
			priv={{ db_name }}.*:ALL
			host=localhost


Note that strings enclosed in {{ }} denote variables. In this task, we have the variables {{ db_user }}, {{ db_password}} and {{ db_name }}. We are going to set the values of these variables in a later step.

Next, we need to let Ansible know that this role has two tasks. To do this, we create a main.yml file.


		#
		nano ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/roles/mysql/tasks/main.yml


Add the following code to this file:


		#
		#
		---
		- include: setup.yml
		- include: create_db.yml


Step 7  Create a Role to Install Drupal
+++

It's now time to move on to the installation of Drupal itself.

Create directories for this role and its tasks.


		#
		mkdir -p ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/roles/drupal/tasks


Use nano to create and edit a task file named main.yml.


		#
		nano ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/roles/drupal/tasks/main.yml


In this task, we will tell Ansible to perform the following actions:



    - Install git on the remote host. This is necessary because we will be using Ansible's git module
    - Use Ansible's git module to clone the latest stable version of Drupal from its repository at http://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git. The downloaded files are placed in /var/www/html/drupal
    - Create the settings.php and services.yml files from the default files
    - Update the permissions of settings.php, services.yml, and sites/default/files


Add the following code to the file:


		#
		#
		---

		- name: Install git
		  apt: name=git state=latest

		- name: Clone Drupal
		  git: >
			repo=http://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git
			dest=/var/www/html/drupal/
			update=no

		- name: Create settings.php
		  command: cp /var/www/html/drupal/sites/default/default.settings.php /var/www/html/drupal/sites/default/settings.php

		- name: Create services.yml
		  command: cp /var/www/html/drupal/sites/default/default.services.yml /var/www/html/drupal/sites/default/services.yml

		- name: Update permissions of settings.php
		  file: path=/var/www/html/drupal/sites/default/settings.php mode=777

		- name: Update permissions of services.yml
		  file: path=/var/www/html/drupal/sites/default/services.yml mode=777

		- name: Update permissions of files directory
		  file: >
			path=/var/www/html/drupal/sites/default/files
			mode=777
			state=directory
			recurse=yes



You'll want to update the permissions for these files later after completing the browser installations on each server (on each server, rather than through Ansible).


Step 8  Create a File to Use All the Roles
+++


At this point, all our roles are ready. We now need to use them.

Use nano to create a file named site.yml. This is the file we will actually run with Ansible.


		#
		nano ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/site.yml


In this file we perform the following activities:

    - Specify the hosts that this Playbook will run on
    - Specify that sudo should be used to run all tasks of this Playbook
    - Set default values to variables used in various roles
    - Run all the roles

Add the following code to it:


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: drupal_hosts
		  sudo: yes
		  vars:
			- db_name: drupal
			- db_user: drupal_user
			- db_password: drupal_db_pass
		  roles:
			- update
			- php
			- mysql
			- drupal


Make sure you change the value of the variable db_password to something other than drupal_db_pass. You are free to change the values of the other two variables as well to match your preferences.


Step 9  Establish an SSH Connection
+++


Before you run the Playbook, your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file should have an entry for each of the hosts mentioned in the hosts file.

An easy way to do this is to connect once to each server listed in the ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/hosts file from this server, using SSH.

Connect to localhost via SSH using the command:


		#
		ssh localhost


If this is the first time you are connecting to the server this way, you will be prompted with a message that says:


		#
		The authenticity of host 'localhost (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
		ECDSA key fingerprint is b1:18:3d:19:15:21:39:5a:f7:9f:3c:37:68:ba:62:01.
		Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?


Once you say yes, you will get a message saying:


		#
		Warning: Permanently added 'localhost' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.


Connect to any other servers listed in the hosts file:


		#
		ssh drupal_sudo_user@drupal_server_ip



Make sure you replace the username and IP address with the actual information for each server. Please keep in mind that the sudo username (drupal_sudo_user in the example) and password should be the same for each server, including localhost.

    Note: Instead of using passwords, you could copy the SSH public key for the Ansible server's sudo user to the drupal_sudo_user's authorized_keys file on each managed server.

Once you have connected to each server, you are ready to run the playbook.


Step 10  Run the Playbook
+++


The Playbook is now ready to be tested. Fire it off using the ansible-playbook command. The -k option forces Ansible to ask for the SSH password, and is not necessary if you have set up passwordless authentication. The -K option forces Ansible to ask for the sudo password.


		#
		cd ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/


$ ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml -kK
---


Step 11  Set Up Drupal
+++

Now, you will be able to use a browser to access Drupal and complete the browser-based installation, at 


		#
		http://your_server_ip/drupal/.

Drupal Setup Page

If you need help with completing the browser installer for Drupal, follow along with the instructions in this article.

Your database settings will be the variables you set in the vars section of the ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/site.yml file.

Double-check that each server has a successful Drupal installation.



Step 12  Clean Up the Host List
+++

Now's a good time to remove the hosts from the ~/MyPlaybooks/drupal_setup/hosts file. That way, if you run the playbook again, you won't accidentally overwrite the hosts that you have already set up.


Troubleshooting
+++

Note that YAML is whitespace-sensitive. If you are having trouble with your playbook, you probably have improper indentation or extra spaces in your .yml files.

If you see an error that looks like:


		#
		fatal: [server-name] => Using a SSH password instead of a key is not possible because Host Key checking is enabled and sshpass does not support this.  Please add this host's fingerprint to your known_hosts file to manage this host.



This means you missed adding an entry for one or more hosts in the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file.

You'll need to make a manual SSH connection to localhost or to the target remote server first. Then try running the playbook again.



Conclusion


With this tutorial, you have learned to create an Ansible playbook that sets up Drupal for you, along with Apache and MySQL. Before you use this playbook in production systems, you will have to further build on it to make the installation more secure. You could also use Drush commands in the playbook to manage the Drupal installation.

Introduction
+++

Apache is one of the most popular web servers currently used on the Internet. It is easy to set up and configure on Linux distributions like Ubuntu and Debian, as it comes in the package repositories and includes a default configuration that works out of the box.


Ansible is an automation tool that allows you to remotely configure systems, install software, and perform complex tasks across a large fleet of servers without needing to manually log into each. Unlike other alternatives, Ansible is installed on a single host, which can even be your local machine, and uses SSH to communicate with each remote host. This allows it to be incredibly fast at configuring new servers, as there are no prerequisite packages to be installed on each new server. It is incredibly easy to use and understand, since it uses playbooks in yaml format using a simple module based syntax.


Prerequisites
+++

For this tutorial, we will install Ansible on a new Ubuntu 14.04 master Droplet and use it to configure Apache on a second Droplet. That said, keep in mind that one of the benefits of Ansible is that you can have it installed on your local machine and manage other hosts without needing to manually ssh into them.

For this tutorial, you will need:

    - Two Ubuntu 14.04 Droplets: one master Droplet with Ansible and one secondary Droplet which will run Apache configured through Ansible
    - Sudo non-root users for both Droplets.
    - Ansible installed on the master Droplet. Follow this tutorial (up to the Set Up SSH Keys section). Although that tutorial was written for Ubuntu 12.04, it is still relevant for Ubuntu 14.04.
    - SSH keys for the master Droplet to authorize login on the secondary Droplet, which you can do following this tutorial on the master Droplet.
    - Active DNS records, or manually set up a local hosts file on your local machine (using your secondary Droplet's IP address), in order to set up and use the Virtual Hosts that will be configured.




Note: This tutorial follows the concepts explained in the existing tutorial:
How To Configure the Apache Web Server on an Ubuntu or Debian VPS. Please review that tutorial if you would like more information, or would like to review the manual process alongside the Ansible process.


Step 1  Configuring Ansible
+++

In this section we will configure Ansible to be able to manage your server.

The first step, once Ansible is installed, is to tell Ansible which hosts to talk to. To do this, we need to create an Ansible hosts file. The Ansible hosts file contains groups of hosts, which we refer to when running Ansible commands. By default this is located in /etc/ansible/hosts. However, that is applied globally across your system and often requires admin permissions. Instead, to make things simpler, we need to tell Ansible to use a local hosts file.


Ansible always looks for an ansible.cfg file in the local directory that it is being run from, and if found will override the global configuration with the local values. With this in mind, all we need to do is tell Ansible that we want to use a hosts file in the local directory, rather than the global one.

Create a new directory (which we will use for the rest of this tutorial).


		#
		mkdir ansible-apache

Move into the new directory.


		#
		cd ~/ansible-apache/


Create a new file called ansible.cfg and open it for editing.


		#
		nano ansible.cfg


Within that file, we want to add in the hostfile configuration option with the value of hosts, within the [defaults] group. Copy the following into the ansible.cfg file, then save and close it.


		#
		[defaults]
		hostfile = hosts


Next, the hosts file needs to be written. There are a lot of options available for the hosts file. However, we can start with something very simple.

Create a hosts file and open it for editing.


		#
		nano hosts

Copy the following into the hosts file.


		#
		[apache]
		secondary_server_ip ansible_ssh_user=username


This specifies a host group called apache which contains one host. Replace secondary_server_ip with the secondary server's hostname or IP address, and username with your SSH username. Now Ansible should be able to connect to your server.

Note: The ansible_ssh_user=username component is optional if you are running Ansible as the same user as the target host.


To test that Ansible is working and can talk to your host, you can run a basic ansible command. Ansible comes with a lot of default modules, but a good place to start is the ping module. It checks it can connect to each host, which makes checking the hosts file for correctness easy.

Basic usage of the ansible command accepts the host group, and the module name: ansible <group> -m <module>. To run the ping command, enter the following command.


$ ansible apache -m ping
---

The output should look like this:


		#
		111.111.111.111 | success >> {
			"changed": false,
			"ping": "pong"
		}



Another Ansible module that is useful for testing is the command module. It runs custom commands on the host and returns the results. To run the command command using echo, a Unix command that echoes a string to the terminal, enter the following command.


$ ansible apache -m command -a "/bin/echo hello sammy"
---


The output should look like this:


		#
		111.111.111.111 | success | rc=0 >>
		hello sammy


This is basic usage of Ansible. The real power comes from creating playbooks containing multiple Ansible tasks. We will cover those next.



Step 2  Creating a Playbook
+++

In this section we will create a basic Ansible playbook to allow you to run more complicated modules easily.

A very basic Ansible playbook is a single yaml file which specifies the host group and one or more tasks to be run on the hosts within the specified group. They are quite simple and easy to read, which is one of the reasons why Ansible is so powerful.

Let's create a basic playbook version of the hello sammy command above.

Create a file called apache.yml and open it for editing.


		#
		nano apache.yml


Copy the following text into the file, then save and close it.


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: apache
		  tasks:
			- name: run echo command
			  command: /bin/echo hello sammy



The hosts: apache declaration is at the top, which tells Ansible that we are using the apache hosts group. This is the equivalent of passing it via the ansible command. Next there is a list of tasks. In this example, we have one task with the name run echo command. This is simply a description intended for the user to understand what the task is doing. Finally, the command: /bin/echo hello sammy line runs the command module with the arguments /bin/echo hello sammy.



The ansible-playbook command is used to run playbooks, and the simplest usage is: ansible-playbook your-playbook.yml. We can run the playbook we just created with the following command.


$ ansible-playbook apache.yml
---

The output should look like this.


		#
		PLAY [apache] *****************************************************************

		GATHERING FACTS ***************************************************************
		ok: [111.111.111.111]

		TASK: [run echo command] ******************************************************
		changed: [111.111.111.111]

		PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************
		111.111.111.111            : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0



The most important thing to notice here is that playbooks do not return the output of the module, so unlike the direct command we used in Step 1, we cannot see if hello sammy was actually printed. This means that playbooks are better suited for tasks where you don't need to see the output. Ansible will tell you if there was an error during the execution of a module, so you generally only need to rely on that to know if anything goes wrong.


Step 3  Installing Apache
+++


Now that we have introduced playbooks, we will write the task to install the Apache web server.

Normally on Ubuntu, installing Apache is a simple case of installing the apache2 package via apt-get. To do this via Ansible, we use Ansible's apt module. The apt module contains a number of options for specialised apt-get functionality. The options we are interested in are:

    - name: The name of the package to be installed, either a single package name or a list of packages.
    - state: Accepts either latest, absent, or present. Latest ensures the latest version is installed, present simply checks it is installed, and absent removes it if it is installed.
    - update_cache: Updates the cache (via apt-get update) if enabled, to ensure it is up to date.

Note: Package managers other than apt have modules too. Each module page has examples that usually cover all of the main use cases, making it very easy to get a feel for how to use each module. It is rare to have to look elsewhere for usage instructions.

Now let's update our apache.yml playbook with the apt module instead of the command module. Open up the apache.yml file for editing again.


		#
		nano apache.yml

Delete the text currently there and copy the following text into it.


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: apache
		  sudo: yes
		  tasks:
			- name: install apache2
			  apt: name=apache2 update_cache=yes state=latest



The apt line installs the apache2 package (name=apache2) and ensures we have updated the cache (update_cache=yes). Although it is optional, including state=latest to be explicit that it should be installed is a good idea.

Unless your Playbook is running as root on each host, sudo will be required to ensure the right privileges. Ansible supports sudo as part of a simple option within the Playbook. It can also be applied via the ansible-playbook command and on a per-task level.


Now run the playbook.

$ ansible-playbook apache.yml --ask-sudo-pass
---


The --ask-sudo-pass flag will prompt you for the sudo password on the secondary Droplet. This is necessary because the installation requires root privileges; the other commands we've run so far did not.

The output should look like this.


		#
		PLAY [apache] *****************************************************************

		GATHERING FACTS ***************************************************************
		ok: [111.111.111.111]

		TASK: [install apache2] *******************************************************
		changed: [111.111.111.111]

		PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************
		111.111.111.111            : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0



If you visit your secondary server's hostname or IP address in your browser, you should now get a Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page to greet you. This means you have a working Apache installation on your server, and you haven't manually connected to it to run a command yet.

An important concept to note at this point is idempotence, which underlies how Ansible modules are supposed to behave. The idea is that you can run the same command repeatedly, but if everything was configured on the first run, then all subsequent runs make no changes. Almost all Ansible modules support it, including the apt module.

For example, run the same playbook command again.


The output should look like this. Note the changed=0 section.


		#
		PLAY [apache] *****************************************************************

		GATHERING FACTS ***************************************************************
		ok: [111.111.111.111]

		TASK: [install apache2] *******************************************************
		ok: [111.111.111.111]

		PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************
		111.111.111.111            : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0




This tells you that the apache2 package was already installed, so nothing was changed. When dealing with complicated playbooks across many hosts, being able to identify the hosts that were different becomes very useful. For example, if you notice a host always needs a specific config updated, then there is likely a user or process on that host which is changing it. Without idempotence, this may never be noticed.


Step 4  Configuring Apache Modules
+++

Now that Apache is installed, we need to enable a module to be used by Apache.

Let us make sure that the mod_rewrite module is enabled for Apache. Via SSH, this can be done easily by using a2enmod and restarting Apache. However, we can also do it very easily with Ansible using the apache2_module module and a task handler to restart apache2.

The apache2_module module takes two options:

     - name  The name of the module to enable, such as rewrite.
     - state  Either present or absent, depending on if the module needs to be enabled or disabled.

Open apache.yml for editing.


Update the file to include this task. The file should now look like this:


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: apache
		  sudo: yes
		  tasks:
			- name: install apache2
			  apt: name=apache2 update_cache=yes state=latest

			- name: enabled mod_rewrite
			  apache2_module: name=rewrite state=present


However, we need to restart apache2 after the module is enabled. One option is to add in a task to restart apache2, but we don't want that to run every time we apply our playbook. To get around this, we need to use a task handler. The way handlers work is that a task can be told to notify a handler when it has changed, and the handler only runs when the task has been changed.

To do this we need to add the notify option into the apache2_module task, and then we can use the service module to restart apache2 in a handler.


That results in a playbook that looks like this:


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: apache
		  sudo: yes
		  tasks:
			- name: install apache2
			  apt: name=apache2 update_cache=yes state=latest

			- name: enabled mod_rewrite
			  apache2_module: name=rewrite state=present
			  notify:
				- restart apache2

		  handlers:
			- name: restart apache2
			  service: name=apache2 state=restarted


Now, rerun the playbook.


$ ansible-playbook apache.yml --ask-sudo-pass
---

The output should look like:



		#
		PLAY [apache] *****************************************************************

		GATHERING FACTS ***************************************************************
		ok: [111.111.111.111]

		TASK: [install apache2] *******************************************************
		ok: [111.111.111.111]

		TASK: [enabled mod_rewrite] ***************************************************
		changed: [111.111.111.111]

		NOTIFIED: [restart apache2] ***************************************************
		changed: [111.111.111.111]

		PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************
		111.111.111.111            : ok=4    changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0



It looks good so far. Now, run the command again and there should be no changes, and the restart task won't be listed.




Step 5  Configuring Apache Options
+++

Now that we have a working Apache installation, with our required modules turned on, we need to configure Apache.

By default Apache listens on port 80 for all HTTP traffic. For the sake of the tutorial, let us assume that we want Apache to listen on port 8081 instead. With the default Apache configuration on Ubuntu 14.04 x64, there are two files that need to be updated:


		#
		/etc/apache2/ports.conf
			Listen 80

		#
		/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
			<VirtualHost *:80>


To do this, we can use the lineinfile module. This module is incredibly powerful and through the use of it's many different configuration options, it allows you to perform all sorts of changes to an existing file on the host. For this example, we will use the following options:



    - dest  The file to be updated as part of the command.
    - regexp  Regular Expression to be used to match an existing line to be replaced.
    - line  The line to be inserted into the file, either replacing the regexp line or as a new line on the end.
    - state  Either present or absent.


Note: The lineinfile module will append the line on the end of the file if it doesn't match an existing line with the regexp. The options insertbefore and insertafter can specify lines to add it before or after instead of at the end, if needed.

What we need to do to update the port from 80 to 8081 is look for the existing lines which define port 80, and change them to define port 8081. 


Open the apache.yml file for editing.


Amend the additional lines so that the file looks like this:


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: apache
		  sudo: yes
		  tasks:
			- name: install apache2
			  apt: name=apache2 update_cache=yes state=latest

			- name: enabled mod_rewrite
			  apache2_module: name=rewrite state=present
			  notify:
				- restart apache2

			- name: apache2 listen on port 8081
			  lineinfile: dest=/etc/apache2/ports.conf regexp="^Listen 80" line="Listen 8081" state=present
			  notify:
				- restart apache2

			- name: apache2 virtualhost on port 8081
			  lineinfile: dest=/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf regexp="^<VirtualHost \*:80>" line="<VirtualHost *:8081>" state=present
			  notify:
				- restart apache2

		  handlers:
			- name: restart apache2
			  service: name=apache2 state=restarted


It is important to notice that we also need to restart apache2 as part of this process, and that we can re-use the same handler but the hanlder will only be triggered once despite multiple changed tasks.


Now run the playbook.


$ ansible-playbook apache.yml --ask-sudo-pass
---


Once Ansible has finished, you should be able to visit your host in your browser and it will respond on port 8081, rather than port 80. In most web browsers, this can be easily achieved by adding :port onto the end of the URL: http://111.111.111.111:8081/.


The lineinfile module is very powerful, and makes mangling existing configurations really easy. The only catch is that you need to know what to expect in the files you are changing with it, but it supports a wide variety of options that support most simple use cases.


Step 6  Configuring Virtual Hosts
+++

Ansible features a couple of modules that provide the ability to copy a local (to Ansible) template file onto the hosts. The two most commonly used modules for this purpose are the copy module and the template module. The copy module copies a file as-is and makes no changes to it, whereas the more powerful template module copies across a template and applies variable substitution to areas you specify by using double curly brackets (i.e. {{ variable }}).

In this section we will use the template module to configure a new virtual host on your server. There will be a lot of changes, so we'll explain them piece by piece, and include the entire updated apache.yml file at the end of this step.


Create Virtual Host Configuration
---

The first step is to create a new virtual host configuration. We'll create the virtual host configuration file on the master Droplet and upload it to the secondary Droplet using Ansible.

Here's an example of a basic virtual host configuration which we can use as a starting point for our own configuration. Notice that both the port number and the domain name, hilighted below, are hardcoded into the configuration.


		#
		#
		<VirtualHost *:8081>
			ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com
			ServerName example.com
			ServerAlias www.example.com
			DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com
			ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
			CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
		</VirtualHost>



Create a new file called virtualhost.conf.


		#
		nano virtualhost.conf


Paste the following into virtualhost.conf. Because we are using templates, it is a good idea to change the hard coded values above to variables, to make them easy to change in the future.


		#
		<VirtualHost *:{{ http_port }}>
			ServerAdmin webmaster@{{ domain }}
			ServerName {{ domain }}
			ServerAlias www.{{ domain }}
			DocumentRoot /var/www/{{ domain }}
			ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
			CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
		</VirtualHost>


Use Template Variables
---

Next, we need to update our playbook to push out the template and use the variables.

The first step is to add in a section into the playbook for variables. It is called vars and goes on the same level as hosts, sudo, tasks, and handlers. We need to put in both variables used in the template above, and we will change the port back to 80 in the process.


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: apache
		  sudo: yes
		  vars:
			http_port: 80
			domain: example.com
		  tasks:
			- name: install apache2
		...



Variables can be used in tasks and templates, so we can update our existing lineinfile modules to use the specified http_port, rather than the hard coded 8081 we specified before. The variable needs to be added into the line, and the regexp option needs to be updated so it's not looking for a specific port. The changes will look like this:


		#
		lineinfile: dest=/etc/apache2/ports.conf regexp="^Listen " line="Listen {{ http_port }}" state=present
		lineinfile: dest=/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf regexp="^<VirtualHost \*:" line="<VirtualHost *:{{ http_port }}>"



Add Template Module
---


The next step is to add in the template module to push the configuration file onto the host. We will use these options to make it happen:

    - dest The destination file path to save the updated template on the host(s), i.e. /etc/apache2/sites-available/{{ domain }}.conf.
    - src The source template file, i.e. virtualhost.conf.


Applying these to your playbook will result in a task that looks like this:


		#
		- name: create virtual host file
		  template: src=virtualhost.conf dest=/etc/apache2/sites-available/{{ domain }}.conf




Enable the Virtual Host
---

Almost done! What we need to do now is enable the virtual host within Apache. This can be done in two ways: by running the sudo a2ensite example.com command or manually symlinking the config file into /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/. The former option is safer, as it allows Apache to control the process. For this, the command module comes in use again.

The usage is quite simple, as we discovered above:


		#
		- name: a2ensite {{ domain }}
		  command: a2ensite {{ domain }}
		  notify:
		  - restart apache2


Prevent Extra Work
---

Finally, the command module needs to know when it should and shouldn't run, so the module is not run unnecessarily if the playbook is run multiple times. In our case, it only needs to be run if the .conf file hasn't been created on the host yet.

This is done using the creates option, which allows you to tell the module what file is being created during the module execution. If the file exists, the module won't run. Because Apache creates a symlink when sites are enabled, checking for that solves the problem.


The changes will look like this:


		#
		- name: a2ensite {{ domain }}
		  command: a2ensite {{ domain }}
		  args:
			creates: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/{{ domain }}.conf
		  notify:
		  - restart apache2


It is important to note the use of the args section in the task. This is an optional way of listing the module options, and in this case removes any confusion between what is a module option and what is the command itself.


Final apache.yml Playbook
+++

With all of the changes above, change your apache.yml playbook to look like this.


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: apache
		  sudo: yes
		  vars:
			http_port: 80
			domain: example.com
		  tasks:
			- name: install apache2
			  apt: name=apache2 update_cache=yes state=latest

			- name: enabled mod_rewrite
			  apache2_module: name=rewrite state=present
			  notify:
				- restart apache2

			- name: apache2 listen on port {{ http_port }}
			  lineinfile: dest=/etc/apache2/ports.conf regexp="^Listen " line="Listen {{ http_port }}" state=present
			  notify:
				- restart apache2

			- name: apache2 virtualhost on port {{ http_port }}

Save and close the file, then run the playbook.

$ ansible-playbook apache.yml --ask-sudo-pass
---

If you now visit the hostname or IP address of your secondary Droplet in your browser, you will see it responds on port 80 again, not port 8081. Next, visit the domain (i.e. example.com) we specified for the new virtual host. Because we haven't added any files in yet, it should show an Apache 404 error page rather than the Apache welcome page. If so, your virtual host is working correctly, and you still haven't SSH'ed into your secondary Droplet to run a single command.



Step 7  Using a Git Repository For Your Website
+++


In this section we will use Ansible to clone a Git repository in order to set up your website content.

Every website needs content, and although it is normal to SSH in and manually clone a Git repository to set up a new website, Ansible provides us with the tools we need to do it automatically. For this example, the git module will do what is required.

The git module has a lot of options, with the relevant ones for this tutorial being:


    - dest -- The path on the host where the repository will be checked out to.
    - repo -- The repository url that will be cloned. This must be accessible by the host.
    - update -- When set to no, this prevents Ansible from updating the repository when it already exists.
    - accept_hostkey -- Tells SSH to accept any unknown host key when connecting via SSH. This is very useful as it saves the need to login via SSH to accept the first login attempt, but it does remove the ability to manually check the host signature. Depending on your repository, you may need this option.



For the purposes of the tutorial, there is a simple Git repository with a single index.html page that can be cloned onto your host. If you already have another public repository that contains similar, feel free to substitute it. With that in mind, the git task will look like this:


		#
		- name: clone basic html template
		  git: repo=https://github.com/do-community/ansible-apache-tutorial.git dest=/var/www/example.com update=no


However, if you ran the Playbook now, you would probably get an error. We first need to install the git package so Ansible can use it to clone the repository. The apt task needs to be updated to install both the apache2 package and the git package. Checking the apt documentation tells us that the name option only takes a single package, so that won't help. Instead, we need to use a list of items.

Ansible provides the ability to specify a list of items to loop through and apply the task to each. They are specified using the with_items option as part of the task, and our apt task will be updated to look like this:


		#
		- name: install packages
		  apt: name={{ item }} update_cache=yes state=latest
		  with_items:
			- apache2
			- git



The list of items uses the item variable and will execute the task for each item in the list.


Open apache.yml again.

Update the playbook to match the following:


		#
		#
		---
		- hosts: apache
		  sudo: yes

		  vars:
			http_port: 80
			domain: example.com

		  tasks:

			- name: install packages
			  apt: name={{ item }} update_cache=yes state=latest
			  with_items:
				- apache2
				- git

			- name: enabled mod_rewrite
			  apache2_module: name=rewrite state=present
			  notify:
				- restart apache2

			- name: apache2 listen on port {{ http_port }}
			  lineinfile: dest=/etc/apache2/ports.conf regexp="^Listen " line="Listen {{ http_port }}" state=present
			  notify:
				- restart apache2

			- name: apache2 virtualhost on port {{ http_port }}
			  lineinfile: dest=/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf regexp="^<VirtualHost \*:" line="<VirtualHost *:{{ http_port }}>"
			  notify:
				- restart apache2

			- name: create virtual host file
			  template: src=virtualhost.conf dest=/etc/apache2/sites-available/{{ domain }}.conf

			- name: a2ensite {{ domain }}
			  command: a2ensite {{ domain }}
			  args:
				creates: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/{{ domain }}.conf
			  notify:
				- restart apache2

			- name: clone basic html template
			  git: repo=https://github.com/do-community/ansible-apache-tutorial.git dest=/var/www/example.com update=no

		  handlers:
			- name: restart apache2
			  service: name=apache2 state=restarted



Save the file and run the playbook.

ansible-playbook apache.yml --ask-sudo-pass

It should install git and successfully clone the repository. You should now see something other than a 404 error when you visit the virtual host from Step 6. Don't forget to check the non virtual host is still returning the default page.

In summary, you now have Git installed and a basic HTML page has been cloned via Git onto your new virtual host. There are still no manual SSH commands required. If you're only after a basic HTML website, and it's in a public Git repository, then you are done!


Conclusion

We have just created an Ansible Playbook to automate the entire process of configuring your host to run the Apache Web Server, with virtual hosts, and a Git repository. All of that has been achieved without needing to log directly into the server, and the best part is that you can run your new Playbook against most Ubuntu servers to achieve the same result.

Note: if your host already has Apache set up and modified, you will most likely need to handle each of the modifications to bring it back to the required state. On the positive side, Ansible will only fix these modifications if they exist, so it's safe to have them in the main Playbook!

Ansible is incredibly powerful and also has a very easy learning curve. You can start off using the basic concepts covered in this tutorial and either stay at this level or learn a lot more to get to the really complicated parts. Either way, you will be able to configure and manage your server(s) without needing to manually login for most, if not all, tasks.
