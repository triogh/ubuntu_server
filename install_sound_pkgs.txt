Enable sound on fresh Ubuntu install

1.
sudo apt-get update
2.
sudo apt-get install alsa-base pulseaudio
sudo alsa force-reload
3.
run "alsamixer" command
4.
-in "alsamixer" make sure output is not muted (MM) 
-needs to be unmuted (00), "m" toggles mute on and off 
-also make sure to increase volume to some value above zero
-take note that mute (MM) and volume value, are two separate things 
-even if you increase volume in "alsamixer" above zero, but mute (MM) is in effect, you will have no sound
